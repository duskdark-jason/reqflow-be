                + "## Project Onboarding Workflow\n\n"
                + "1. Confirm the current Codex session has loaded the reqflow MCP server and exposes `mcp__reqflow.get_harness_template`, `mcp__reqflow.publish_repository_index`, and `mcp__reqflow.register_harness_init_result`.\n"
                + "2. Call `mcp__reqflow.get_harness_template` first with the project ID from the instruction or platform context.\n"
                + "3. In each target repository, verify the remote, switch to the registered default branch, and run `git pull --ff-only` before writing files.\n"
                + "4. Write or merge the returned `workspaceFiles` and `repositoryHarnessInstructions[].files` into the target workspace and repositories.\n"
                + "5. Ensure `docs/ai-harness/search-map.md` and `docs/process/local-harness-workflow.md` exist in each repository. Maintain search keywords, entry documents, and code entry points before init checks.\n"
                + "6. In each target repository, run `sh scripts/check-docs.sh` and `sh scripts/check-harness.sh init` when those scripts are present.\n"
                + "7. After init checks pass, commit and push the generated or upgraded `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, and `scripts/` files.\n"
                + "8. Before publishing the index, inspect frontend routes, menus, page components, and API wrappers. Build `modules` as concrete frontend page business functions, menu entries, submenus, or hidden tabs. For backend-only repositories, map modules to companion frontend menus, MCP capabilities, or background jobs.\n"
                + "9. Publish each repository index with `mcp__reqflow.publish_repository_index`. `modules` must not be empty; each module should represent one frontend page business function or backend capability, and `pages/apis/tables/permissions/documents` must reference the matching `moduleCode`. Re-publishing the same repository branch is a snapshot sync; modules and impact items omitted from the new payload are no longer active in reqflow. Put the action token in `arguments.actionToken`; do not use it as `X-MCP-Key`.\n"
                + "10. Register the local harness result, commit, push result, and failure reason with `mcp__reqflow.register_harness_init_result`.\n\n"
                + "## Requirement Analysis Workflow\n\n"
                + "1. Read the demand detail, draft package, context manifest, repository remote, baseline branch, suggested task branch, historical design versions, and demander supplemental instructions from reqflow MCP resources or instruction content.\n"
                + "2. Verify the current workspace repository remote, switch to the target baseline branch, run `git pull --ff-only`, then create or switch to the suggested ASCII task branch.\n"
                + "3. Write the feasibility assessment first. The conclusion must be one of 可继续设计, 需澄清, 需调整, or 暂不可实现, with risks, blockers, and demander follow-up items.\n"
                + "4. Upload the assessment with `mcp__reqflow.upload_requirement_assessment`; pass the assessment action token as `arguments.actionToken`, never as `X-MCP-Key`.\n"
                + "5. Stop after uploading the assessment. If the conclusion is 需澄清, 需调整, or 暂不可实现, surface the feedback for the demander. If it is 可继续设计, wait for the platform to move to requirement generation and provide a new instruction.\n"
                + "6. Do not call `mcp__reqflow.save_requirement_package`, write final `requirement.md`, write `plan.md`, implement code, or write execution/review reports during requirement analysis.\n\n"
                + "## Requirement Generation Workflow\n\n"
                + "1. Read the approved assessment, demand detail, historical design versions, repository remote, baseline branch, suggested task branch, and demander supplemental instructions from reqflow.\n"
                + "2. Use the task branch created during requirement analysis. Do not create a different branch.\n"
                + "3. Update only `meta.md` and `requirement.md`, then call `mcp__reqflow.save_requirement_package` with the generation action token in `arguments.actionToken`.\n"
                + "4. Do not call `mcp__reqflow.upload_requirement_assessment`, write `plan.md`, implement code, or write execution/review reports during requirement generation.\n\n"
                + "## Requirement Development Workflow\n\n"
                + "1. Read the confirmed requirement design and task branch from reqflow, then switch to the task branch created during requirement design. Do not create a different branch.\n"
                + "2. Before writing `plan.md`, decide whether the work can be split across multiple subagents. Split only when boundaries are clear, shared state is avoided, and each subtask can be independently verified; otherwise keep a single execution path.\n"
                + "3. Generate or update `plan.md`, execute the work, and upload the development plan with `mcp__reqflow.save_development_plan`.\n"
                + "4. Upload the execution result with `mcp__reqflow.upload_execution_report`.\n"
                + "5. Run automatic review before moving the demand to acceptance, then upload the review result with `mcp__reqflow.upload_review_report`.\n"
                + "6. Use the same development-stage action token for the three development tools; put it in `arguments.actionToken`. The token is valid only while the demand stays in the current development stage, with a 24-hour maximum fallback. Personnel authentication still uses `X-MCP-Key`.\n\n"
                + "## Requirement Repair Workflow\n\n"
                + "1. Read the current repair instruction, review report, execution report, confirmed requirement design, and task branch from reqflow.\n"
                + "2. Switch to the existing task branch. Do not create a different branch and do not regenerate `requirement.md` or `plan.md`.\n"
                + "3. Fix only the listed RF items or demander repair notes, then update the same `execution-report.md` and upload it with `mcp__reqflow.upload_execution_report`.\n"
                + "4. Run or hand off re-review, update the same `review-report.md`, and upload it with `mcp__reqflow.upload_review_report`.\n"
                + "5. Use the same repair-stage action token for the two repair tools; put it in `arguments.actionToken`. The token is valid only while the demand stays in the current repair stage, with a 24-hour maximum fallback. Personnel authentication still uses `X-MCP-Key`.\n\n"
                + "## Local Harness Workflow Without MCP\n\n"
                + "1. Trigger this mode when no Reqflow Key is provided, MCP is not connected, MCP tools are unavailable in the current Codex session, or the user explicitly says to use local Harness mode.\n"
                + "2. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/process/local-harness-workflow.md`, `docs/ai-harness/harness-index.json`, `docs/ai-harness/search-map.md`, and `docs/ai-harness/change-checklist.md`.\n"
                + "3. Use the same local files as MCP mode: `meta.md`, `requirement.md`, `plan.md`, `execution-report.md`, and `review-report.md` under `docs/specs/active/REQ-001-中文需求标题/`.\n"
                + "4. Keep the same phase gates: requirement design before execution, Execution Agent before Review Agent, `RF-*` repair loop before final pass, and `sh scripts/check-harness.sh complete` for completion.\n"
                + "5. Do not claim `upload_requirement_assessment`, `save_requirement_package`, `upload_execution_report`, or `upload_review_report` succeeded unless the MCP tool was actually called. Write `未接入 MCP，本地文件闭环` instead.\n"
                + "6. If MCP later becomes available, local spec files may be used as input for platform registration, but the agent must preserve real Key, branch, commit, and upload evidence.\n\n"
                + "## Requirement Closeout Workflow\n\n"
                + "1. Read the accepted demand, baseline branch, task branch, repository list, and closeout action tokens from reqflow.\n"
                + "2. In each repository, switch to the demand baseline branch, run `git pull --ff-only`, squash merge the local task branch into the baseline branch, and push the baseline branch.\n"
                + "3. Publish the current full repository index snapshot with `mcp__reqflow.publish_repository_index`; put the repository's closeout action token in `arguments.actionToken`, never as `X-MCP-Key`.\n"
                + "4. Wait for reqflow to verify that all active repositories on the demand baseline branch have fresh imported index batches and that the closeout tokens were used.\n"
                + "5. After platform verification passes, delete the local task branch. Do not mark the demand complete before platform verification succeeds.\n\n"
                + "## Guardrails\n\n"
                + "- The reqflow MCP server stores platform context and repository indexes; the local agent writes, commits, and pushes files in the target workspace.\n"
                + "- For multi-repository workspaces, process each registered repository separately.\n"
                + "- Do not publish a repository-level overview as the only module. Project onboarding must persist a concrete business knowledge base derived from frontend pages or equivalent backend capabilities.\n"
                + "- If `publish_repository_index` reports missing index tables, surface the platform migration hint to the user instead of retrying blindly.\n";
